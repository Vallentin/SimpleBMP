SimpleBMP is a small, simple, self-contained and cross-platform library for loading, saving and
handling [BMP (Bitmap) image files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format). 

*The only thing that SimpleBMP uses/requires is the standard library header `<fstream>`.*

---

SimpleBMP is a young library, so any feedback for improvements and/or missing features are welcome!
